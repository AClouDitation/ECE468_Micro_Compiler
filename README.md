This course focuses on the tools and techniques needed to build an optimizing compiler. 
Topics include:

1. Scanning and parsing: determining the syntactic structure of a program
2. Semantic routines: determining the semantics of a program and building an intermediate representation
3. Code generation: emitting assembly code that is equivalent to the program
4. Program optimizations: improving the performance of a program
5. Program analysis: determining interesting information about a programâ€™s behavior
